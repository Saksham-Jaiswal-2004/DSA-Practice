# Data Structures & Algorithms — Learning & Practice

Curated solutions and daily practice across core DSA topics and competitive programming. The goal is to build strong problem‑solving skills and solid CS fundamentals through consistent, structured work.

---

## Objectives
- Learn DSA concepts in depth and apply them
- Strengthen logical thinking and coding fluency
- Prepare for interviews and contests (speed + accuracy)
- Track progress and revisit/refactor older solutions

---

## Folder Map
- [Leetcode](Leetcode) — Interview‑focused problems and topic coverage
	- Overview: [Leetcode/readme.md](Leetcode/readme.md)
- [Codeforces](Codeforces) — Contest solutions optimized for time limits
	- Overview: [Codeforces/readme.md](Codeforces/readme.md)
- [CodeChef](CodeChef) — Practice + contests with performance focus
	- Overview: [CodeChef/readme.md](CodeChef/readme.md)
- [Coding Ninjas](Coding%20Ninjas) — Course‑structured DSA practice
	- Overview: [Coding Ninjas/readme.md](Coding%20Ninjas/readme.md)
- [DSA Practise](DSA%20Practise) — Daily practice by topic

---

## Topics Covered
- Arrays & Strings: two‑pointers, sliding window, prefix/suffix
- Linked Lists: reversal, merging, cycle detection
- Stacks & Queues: monotonic stacks, BFS patterns
- Trees & BST: traversals, LCA, serialization
- Graphs: BFS/DFS, shortest paths, topological sort
- Dynamic Programming: memoization, tabulation (1D/2D)
- Greedy: locally optimal choices → global optimum
- Binary Search: boundary finding, rotated arrays

---

## Languages & Tools
- Languages: C++ (primary), Java, Python, C (as needed)
- Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code
- Platforms: LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, Coding Ninjas

---

## How to Use
1. Pick a folder/topic based on your goal (interview vs contest)
2. Attempt the problem independently first
3. Compare solution approaches and analyze complexity
4. Revisit and refactor with alternative patterns when useful

---

## Conventions
- Clear, readable implementations first; optimize next
- Include approach notes and time/space complexity where applicable
- File naming: numbered prefixes + descriptive names (e.g., `08.NextPermutation.cpp`)
