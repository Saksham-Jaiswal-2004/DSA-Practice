# Data Structures & Algorithms - Learning & Practice

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning and practice work**.  
Everything I study, practice, and implement while learning DSA is added here in an organized manner.

The goal of this repository is to build **strong problem-solving skills** and **solid core computer science fundamentals** through consistent practice.

---

## Objective

- Learn DSA concepts in depth
- Improve logical thinking and problem-solving ability
- Maintain a structured record of my DSA journey
- Prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming
- Track progress over time

---

## Repository Structure

- Code is organized **concept-wise**
- Each folder represents a specific concept or problem category
- Solutions focus on **clarity and correctness**
- The repository evolves as I continue learning

> This is a learning-oriented repository. Code may be refactored or improved as my understanding grows.

## Languages & Tools

- Programming Languages: C, C++, Java, Python (as used during learning)
- Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code
- Practice Platforms: LeetCode, Coding Ninjas, CodeStudio, Codeforces (for problem selection)
