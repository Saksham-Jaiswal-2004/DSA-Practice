# Codeforces Solutions

This folder contains my solutions to Codeforces problems and contests.

## Focus
- Competitive programming at speed and scale
- Strong optimization under tight time limits
- Advanced algorithms and data structures (graphs, DP, greedy, math)

## Notes
- Solutions may prioritize efficiency over readability
- Some files correspond to specific contest rounds (Div 1/2/3, Educational)
- Approaches highlight key insights and complexity trade-offs

## How to Use
1. Open the problem on Codeforces.
2. Attempt independently under time constraints.
3. Compare solution approaches and optimizations here.
4. Review edge cases, hacks, and performance notes.
