# LeetCode Solutions

Comprehensive solutions to LeetCode problems, curated for mastering Data Structures & Algorithms and interview preparation.

## Overview
- Platform: LeetCode (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Focus: Correctness, clarity, and optimized performance
- Organization: By problem number and topic (arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, DP, greedy, etc.)

## Topics Covered
- Arrays & Strings: Two pointers, sliding window, prefix/suffix
- Linked Lists: Reversal, merging, cycle detection
- Stacks & Queues: Monotonic stacks, BFS patterns
- Trees & BST: Traversals, LCA, serialization
- Graphs: BFS/DFS, shortest paths, topological sort
- Dynamic Programming: 1D/2D DP, memoization, tabulation
- Greedy: Local optimal choices leading to global optimum
- Binary Search: Variants, boundaries, rotated arrays

## How to Use
1. Read the problem on LeetCode.
2. Attempt a solution independently.
3. Compare approaches and code here.
4. Review complexity and edge cases.
5. Try an alternative implementation for learning.

## Languages
- C++ (primary), Java, Python (as applicable)

## Notes
- Solutions include clear approaches and complexity analysis.
- Code aims for readability first, then performance.
- Some problems include multiple solutions for comparison.
